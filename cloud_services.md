# Clouds, Services, Servers
### What does it do?
Early on in the history of the internet and smaller networks, the architecture was quite simple.  A server is basically a single computer sitting in a rack and taking requests for a single application, whether that is a website, email, or a gaming server.  This worked for small scale operations but as the application for internet services grew and grew it was found to be insufficient.  Cloud computing treats servers as a service that one company can provide to another.  You may not have your application served from the same physical hardware from day to day and you may not even run the same number of servers.  The cloud could be considered to be renting servers on demand and providing a vast amount of flexibility to meet demand.

Consider the case of a company that sells a product available in its online store.  In the traditional Client-Server arrangement you would own or rent a number of physical servers either on your own premises or in a data center.  The amount of servers available would be enough to match your average demand with some flex room available for some peaks.  Should demand spike, say in the event of an online sale, then the response time for the online store could increase which could potentially result in lost business.  Using cloud computing, you can automatically scale the operation up and down depending on the demand for services.  

#### What makes this possible?
The largest advancement in technology that grew cloud computing was the concept of the Virtual Machine.  This allowed for a single phyiscal server to run a number of virtual servers transparently to the end user.  Another big advancement was the creation of technology like Docker.  Docker allowed for the creation of not just virtual machines, but virtual networks connecting those machines.  These virtual machines can be scripted to start and stop automatically based on almost any criteria, from a failure on one machine to a spike in demand across the network.

#### Future of cloud computing
- More applications in the cloud instead of traditional software installed on a local machine.  
- Movement to apps.

### What is the likely impact?
- Increase in reliance on technology
- Increase in technical jobs relating to the technology
- Environmental impacts?  Will having more centralised computing result in a requirement for less overall machines?

### How will this affect me?
- Easier, faster, more reliable access to online services
- More computing to be done remotely
- More data to be stored remotely
- Disappearing traditional items.  The landline telephone in the home is almost forgotten in the city.
