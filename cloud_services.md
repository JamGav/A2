# Clouds, Services, Servers
### What does it do?
Early on in the history of the internet and smaller networks, the architecture was quite simple.  A server is basically a single computer sitting in a rack and taking requests for a single application, whether that is a website, email, or a gaming server.  This worked for small scale operations but as the application for internet services grew and grew it was found to be insufficient.  Cloud computing treats servers as a service that one company can provide to another.  You may not have your application served from the same physical hardware from day to day and you may not even run the same number of servers.  The cloud could be considered to be renting servers on demand and providing a vast amount of flexibility to meet demand.

Consider the case of a company that sells a product available in its online store.  In the traditional Client-Server arrangement you would own or rent a number of physical servers either on your own premises or in a data center.  The amount of servers available would be enough to match your average demand with some flex room available for some peaks.  Should demand spike, say in the event of an online sale, then the response time for the online store could increase which could potentially result in lost business.  Using cloud computing, you can automatically scale the operation up and down depending on the demand for services.  

#### What makes this possible?
The largest advancement in technology that grew cloud computing was the concept of the Virtual Machine.  This allowed for a single phyiscal server to run a number of virtual servers transparently to the end user.  Another big advancement was the creation of technology like Docker.  Docker allowed for the creation of not just virtual machines, but virtual networks connecting those machines.  These virtual machines can be scripted to start and stop automatically based on almost any criteria, from a failure on one machine, to a spike in demand across the network, to a network failure in an entire area.

#### Is there still a place for on-premisis servers?
This is like asking "how long is a piece of string?".  What works for one organisation may not be appropriate for another.  Some organisations may be particularly security conscious and prefer to have complete control over the hardware, data, and networks.  Others may be running some older legacy services that does not lend itself to more complex network.  

There is still a cost vs benefit split in on-prem vs cloud computing.  The scale of the operation may not warrant big dollars spent on cloud services and may be able to support the servers in house.


#### Future of cloud computing
##### New markets
Cloud providers and data centres are expected to expand around the world continuously over the next few years.  A market in Africa is beginning to emerge as mobile networks increase in speed and penetration across the continent and the internet becomes more accessible.  As this market expands, large and small cloud providers will start to build more datacentres to adaquetly service the growing number of online businesses and consumers.  We could potentially see a revolution in the way the entire African continent conducts commerce.

##### A larger move to cloud?
BYOD is expanding as companies aim to limit expenditure.  There are a couple of problems that face most BYOD companies, one is "How do I secure my data", another is "How do I control costs when trying to support a non standard environment".  An answer to this could be a product like Azure Virtual Desktop.  This allows the same controlled desktop environment to be accessed on any device by a user.  This allows data to be kept more secure than on the users personal device and shifts the responsibility for the maintenance of the computer on to the user


### What is the likely impact?
- Increase in reliance on technology
- Increase in technical jobs relating to the technology
- Environmental impacts?  Will having more centralised computing result in a requirement for less overall machines?

### How will this affect me?
- Easier, faster, more reliable access to online services
- More computing to be done remotely
- More data to be stored remotely
- Disappearing traditional items.  The landline telephone in the home is almost forgotten in the city.
