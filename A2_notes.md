#### Team Profile contribution
My name is Gavin, student number s3925654. I am an Australian who grew up in Brisbane and lives in Sydney.  Currently I am studying Information to IT online via OUA and working on team (team name here).  I have a keen interest in the world around me and learning about why things are the way they are.  My interest in IT stems from a hobby interest in electronics and programming which initially drove me to pursue a trade in Aircraft Electrical Systems (Avionics).  Throughout the years I have tinkered on and off with a number of different Electronic and IT related projects while finding a keen interest in projects that bridge the gap between the physical and the connected world, and automation projects. As someone who is not a huge fan contributor or user of social media, one of my favourite builds was developing my own blog for my travelling based on wordpress.  I was able to develop a unique page on it that would recieve position updates via my HF radio and post them on a map along with short tweets so that family and friends with the link could follow along.


## Ideal Jobs

Our teams individual results from A1s ideal jobs segment showed some differences and similarities across a number of areas.  We found that some of us had similar ideal jobs, albeit in different streams, with one outlier.

Using the burning glass data to identify the top in demand General and IT skills that were shared by at least two members we found that across those different jobs the top skill requirements for each role were varied, although each required some sort of scripting or programming skills.  As such, any programming language(i.e. Java, python, Javascript) was rolled up into the general term "Programming".  The top general skills from the burning glass data showed that the in demand skills were common across all jobs.

We should put something in here about what conclusions we can draw from this data.  Im thinking something along the lines of it driving us to focus on specialising on certain aspects that are more relevant to our desired roles.  It probably couldnt hurt to change up the IT Skill section.
