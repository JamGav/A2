# Pursuit of Hoppiness

## Overview

## Motivation

## Tools + Tech

### Backend
- Local hosting for POC and trials, Launch on cloud for reliability assurance.  I think this is important for when your app expands into markets other than Perth.
- Git based version control
- Database
- Rest API based to make it easier to devlop for different platforms.  This will allow for splitting up of a team into different disciplines.  Back end, iOS, Android, browser based.


### Front end
- iOS currently holds a higher overall market share than android.  Im not sure whether this translates to the target market for the application. (https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/australia)

## Skills
- Database
- Flask
- Rest
- Cloud management
- iOS dev
- Android dev
- web dev

## Outcome
- Could the app be expanded to allow purchases at the venue?  Much like Hey You for coffee stores or Clipp for bars?  This could reduce the burden of requiring significant user input as you could potentially track which beers were bought more than once by a single user
